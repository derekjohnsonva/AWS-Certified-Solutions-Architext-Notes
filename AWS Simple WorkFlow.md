aliases:
  - SWF
---
A fully-managed state tracker and task coordinator in the Cloud. You create desired workflows with their associated tasks and any conditional logic you wish to apply and store them with SWF.

*But when do you use it?*
	Use it when you need to coordinate work between distributed systems.
	An example of this is if your work is split between different services or maybe even compute not running on AWS
